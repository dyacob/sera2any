* sera2any-0.25

* maps for windows fonts are as well tuned as I can get them...

Tue Oct  1 01:36:02 EET DST 1996 (yacob@padis.gn.apc.org)

* Added digit "1" to all implicit #define statements to make non-ANSI
  compilers happy.  Thanks to compile error reports from Assefa A. 
  (ayalew@utsax3.univ.trieste.it).

Sat Sep 28 21:48:34 EET DST 1996 (yacob@padis.gn.apc.org)

* RTF conversion added.

* 2nd arg of fidel_sputc and fidel_sputs changed to type unsigned char.

Fri Sep 27 12:26:25 EET DST 1996 (yacob@padis.gn.apc.org)

* ALXEthiopian and Washra support begin.

Sat Sep 21 10:49:41 EET DST 1996 (yacob@padis.gn.apc.org)

* Syncronized ANSI and non-ANSI C declarations in libeth.h after
  errors reported by Assefa A. (ayalew@utsax3.univ.trieste.it).

* Feedel support begins, Agafari support more or less satisfactory...
  ...need to contact ALXEthiopian, Dashen, WashRa...

* minor updates following warning by gcc's lint like option -Wall

Sat Aug 24 08:56:35 EET DST 1996  (yacob@padis.gn.apc.org)

* TERM and INT signal catching added for crash control and 
  debugging of libeth.

* README.dosio updated for line number changes.

Tue Aug 20 10:17:55 EET DST 1996  (yacob@padis.gn.apc.org)

* ``hard_mode'' renamed ``verbatim'' -this should be more descriptive.

* Corrections made for ``hard_mode'' toggles to work properly.
  Will continue searching for more elegant solutions for this.

Mon Aug 19 01:20:25 EET DST 1996  (yacob@padis.gn.apc.org)

* Extensive parser corrections made for escapes.
  Escaping is now more like TeX as it should have been
  (i.e.  \esc1\esc2 permitted)

* forgotten #ifdef SUPPORT_TEX tags added to driver

Sun Aug 11 21:52:56 EET DST 1996  (yacob@padis.gn.apc.org)

* sera2any-0.24

* TeX output is removed from library and handled in driver.
  TeX output uses macros and does not involve encoding issues.
  This removes a nasty bug I never uncovered...

Sun Jul 21 04:19:55 EET DST 1996  (yacob@padis.gn.apc.org)

* Number of nodes in get_fchar.l boosted to 640 for SGU Lex.

* TeX output now uses {\%s} like Mule.  This avoids the problem of
  TeX eating spaces following \%s.

* Updates to include/fidel.map and lib-src/get_fchar.l for
  TeX support to match revised Mule TeX fidel-to-sera matrix
  in ethio-uni2.el.  

* Extended whitespace definitions for lib-src/get_fchar.l

Fri Jun 28 15:01:56 EET DST 1996  Daniel Yacob  (yacob@padis.gn.apc.org)

* sera2any-0.23

* Updates to include/fidel.map, include/fidel.h and lib-src/get_fchar.l
  for ammendments by ISO committee to UTC-95-055A.

* Use strstr instead of strcmp to get self id from argv[0] 

* ``strip'' added to top level makefile.
