Installation
------------

If you have downloaded the file sera2any-0.XY.tar.Z by ftp (set in binary 
transfer mode); enter the 2 command lines as follows :

    zcat sera2any-0.XY.tar.Z | tar -xvf -

(
  Or in 2 Steps :
    uncompress sera2any-0.XY.tar.Z
    tar -xvf sera2any-0.XY.tar
)

You will find a new subdirectory with the name "sera2any-0.XY" that contains 
the sera2any source files.  If you have obtained your copy of sera2any through 
encoded email, you will need to save the email message as a new file name and 
enter at the window command line :

    uudecode filename

you will then discover a new file has been created with the name 
"sera2any-0.XY.tar.Z" .  At this point follow the 2 commands given for the ftp
instructions above.

Read the "README" file for usage instructions.


TO COMPILE:  

        % make       - makes everything.
        % make clean - removes unnecessary files.


IF YOU DO NOT HAVE gcc AND flex

You should then have ``cc'' and ``lex''.  You may edit the Makefile 
in lines 2 and 5 for gcc and flex.


DEFAULT LANGUAGE

You may change the default language rules by editing commenting out and
uncommenting the choices on lines 27-29 of the sera2.c file.  
Tigrigna rules are the default if no change is made.


Installing Man Pages
---------------------

The files etc/sera.1, etc/sera2any.1 are provided man
page instructions for Unix systems.  If you can not install the
man pages into a system man directory.  You may create your own
man directory by:

   % cd sera2any-0.XY
   % mkdir man
   % mkdir man/man1
   % cp etc/*.1 etc/man1
   % setenv MANPATH $MANPATH":"$PWD/man
   % man sera
   % man sera2any

It is more practical to set your new MANPATH in your .cshrc file
where the $PWD/man directory in the above is replaced the complete
path name for your man directory.


Libeth And DOS I/O
------------------

If you expect to go between DOS and Unix regularly you may wish to
compile libeth to perform DOS text conversions.  DOS I/O is NOT the
default compilation for libeth as it slows down the transileration
performance for large files.  Follow the directions in 
sera2/README.dosio to install for DOS support.
